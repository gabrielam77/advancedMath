## Project Overview
This is a new project based on the original MathtestHebrew repository, set up independently for adding advanced features without affecting the original project.

## Project Information
- **Project Name**: Advanced Math Tutor
- **Location**: `C:\Cursor_REPO\advanced-math-tutor`
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/gabrielam77/advancedMath.git
- **Original Project**: `C:\Cursor_REPO\MathHebrewProject` (unchanged)

## Quick Start

### 1. Open the Workspace
Open the workspace file to get started:
```
C:\Cursor_REPO\advanced-math-tutor\advanced-math-tutor.code-workspace
```

### 2. Start Development Server
Navigate to the React app and start the development server:
```bash
cd C:\Cursor_REPO\advanced-math-tutor\russian-math-tutor
npm start
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
cd C:\Cursor_REPO\advanced-math-tutor\russian-math-tutor
npm test
```

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
cd C:\Cursor_REPO\advanced-math-tutor\russian-math-tutor
npm run build
```
